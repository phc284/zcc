              </a>
              <br />Do you enjoy memes and trolls? Well you'll only find a good amount of the latter in this subreddit with 35,000+ users. You can find very active threads on game days, draft days, and other big events regarding the Cowboys. Every once in a while some good original content will be posted and you can check out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reddit.com/r/nfl">r/NFL</a> for more content from NFL fans. David Helman and Scooter MaGruder are some names that are known to lurk in this forum. You may even find u/Carson Wentz and u/Brian Dawkins around.

                <h3>Cowboys Zone Forum</h3>
              </a>
              <br />Formerly known from cowboys-forum.com, this site is a simple forum based site about the Dallas Cowboys. It has an active community and seems to have more tame users than in the r/Cowboys community. You won't find as many trolls and memes, but much more active discussion about news and issues revolving the teams and players.
